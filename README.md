=============

My first test repository for an ambitious first module which I plan to contribute to drupal.org

The idea behind this module is to provide an additional option for aliasing nodes using Drupal's Batch API. 
When used with a module like Background Process which eliminates the dependency on having a browser window constantly open
this should come in handy for sites with heavy content which need to be aliased. 
If this does not seem satisfactory an explanation consider this one of the many ways to skin a cat.
